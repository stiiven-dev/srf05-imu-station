# plotting (see tools/plot_filters.py). Ctrl+C to stop capturing; the file
# is flushed as it goes, so a hard exit still leaves you a usable log.

# Usage:
#   ./capture-filter-log.sh [elf_path] [output_file]
#
# Defaults:
#   elf_path    -> target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/srf05-imu-station
#   output_file -> filter_log_<timestamp>.txt
